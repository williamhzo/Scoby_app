## General info

This project was built from scratch in 7 days, in the frame of Ironhack's Web Development's bootcamp.

Scoby grew in the mind of three web development students @ Ironhack Paris. It is a platform to give away plant cuttings, kefir seeds, vinegar and kombucha scobies. All those little things you never know where to find, and which would be so nice to share. 

#### Who are we?

We are [Rebecca](https://github.com/rebeccanoren), [Florian](https://github.com/florian-jomain) and [William](https://github.com/williamhzo). Weâ€™re students at the Ironhack Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp in Paris, France. We created Scoby as part as the back-end module project.
