# Freely app

https://scoby-frw.herokuapp.com/

Scoby is a map-based app where people can easily share and find scobies, plant cuttings, or other organic goods.

## General info

This project was built from scratch in 6 days, in the frame of Ironhack's Web Development's bootcamp.

Scoby grew in the mind of three web development students @ Ironhack Paris. It is a platform to give away plant cuttings, kefir seeds, vinegar and kombucha scobies. All those little things you never know where to find, and which would be so nice to share.
